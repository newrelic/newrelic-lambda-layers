# New Relic Lambda Layers

This repository contains source code and utilities to build and publish New Relic's public AWS Lambda layers.

Most users should use our published layers which are chosen automatically via the [CLI tool](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli). Those layers are published to be public and are available [here](https://layers.newrelic-external.com/).

This tool is released for users seeking to deploy their own copies of the New Relic Lambda Layers into their accounts, or to modify and publish their own customized wrapper layers.

## Requirements:

* aws-cli
* bash shell

The AWS cli must be configured, please refer to its [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).

## Publishing Layers:
To publish the layer, modify the runtime according to the options provided in the `.publish-layers.sh` script. Then, run the following command in your shell:

```
cd python
./publish-layers.sh python3.12 
cd ..
```

```
cd nodejs
./publish-layers.sh nodejs20x 
cd ..
```

```
cd ruby
./publish-layers.sh ruby3.3 
cd ..
```

```
cd java
./publish-layers.sh java21
cd ..
```

```
cd dotnet
./publish-layers.sh
cd ..
```

```
cd extension
./publish-layer.sh
cd ..
```

## Attaching Custom Lambda Layer ARNs

The layers published to your account may be used directly within SAM, Cloudformation Templates, Serverless.yml, or other configuration methods that allow specifying the use of layers by ARN.

New Relic Serverless APM customers are advised to use the [newrelic-lambda-cli tool](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli), and this may be used with custom layers as follows by adding the `--layer-arn` flag to the layers install command:

```
newrelic-lambda layers install \
    --function <name or arn> \
    --nr-account-id <new relic account id>
    --layer-arn <YOUR_CUSTOM_LAYER_ARN>
```

## Manual Instrumentation using Layers:

We recommend using the [newrelic-lambda-cli tool](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli), but some users find that they need, or prefer to manually configure their functions.

These steps will help you configure the layers correctly:

1. Find the New Relic AWS Lambda Layer ARN that matches your runtime and region.
2. Copy the ARN of the most recent AWS Lambda Layer version and attach it to your function.
  * Using Cloudformation, this refers to adding your layer arn to the Layers property of a [AWS::Lambda::Function resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-function.html).
3. Update your functions handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function:
  * Python: `newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler`
  * Node: `newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler`
  * Ruby: `newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler`
  * Java:
    * RequestHandler implementation: `com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleRequest`
    * RequestStreamHandlerWrapper implementation: `com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleStreamsRequest`
  * .NET: This step is not required.
4. Add these environment variables to your Lambda console:
  * NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: Your New Relic account ID
  * NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: Path to your initial handler.
  * NEW_RELIC_USE_ESM: For Node.js handlers using ES Modules, set to `true`.
  * CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING (.NET only): 1
  * CORECLR_PROFILER (.NET only): {36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}
  * CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME (.NET only): /opt/lib/newrelic-dotnet-agent
  * CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH (.NET only): /opt/lib/newrelic-dotnet-agent/libNewRelicProfiler.so

Refer to the [New Relic AWS Lambda Monitoring Documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/enable-new-relic-monitoring-aws-lambda) for instructions on completing your configuration by linking your AWS Account and Cloudwatch Log Streams to New Relic.

## Support for ES Modules (Node.js)

AWS announced support for Node 18 as a Lambda runtime in late 2022, introducing `aws-sdk` version 3 for Node 18 only. This version of `aws-sdk` patches `NODE_PATH`, so ESM-supporting functions using `import` and top-level `await` should work as expected with Lambda Layer releases `v9.8.1.1` and above (Numerical layer versions vary by region and runtime). To configure the layer to leverage `import`, add the environment variable `NEW_RELIC_USE_ESM: true`.

Note that if you use layer-installed instrumentation with the `NEW_RELIC_USE_ESM` environment variable, your function must use promises or async/await; callback based functions are not supported. The Node wrapper uses a [dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) to attach to your function, which is an asynchronous operation. If you still need support for callback based functions, you will have to use the CommonJS based wrapper, which can be done by removing the `NEW_RELIC_USE_ESM` environment variable.

You may see some warnings from the Extension in CloudWatch logs referring to a non-standard handler; these warnings may be ignored.

If your Node functions use `import` and top-level `await` in Node 16 or Node 14 runtimes, layer-installed instrumentation will be unable to find imported modules, as [`import` specifiers don't resolve with `NODE_PATH`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/esm.html#no-node_path). You can still instrument your functions with New Relic, but you will need to do the following:

1. [instrument your function manually](#manual-instrumentation-for-es-modules) using our [Node Agent](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/) 
2. On deploying your function, don't set the function handler to our Node wrapper; instead, use your regular handler function, which you've wrapped with `newrelic.setLambdaHandler()`.
3. If you're using Node 18 or above, apply the latest Lambda Layer for your runtime. It will install both the Node agent and our Lambda Extension.
4. If you're using Node 14 or Node 16, you will have to deploy our agent with your function code, but you could use our Extension-only Lambda Layer for delivering telemetry. Use our [layer discovery website](https://layers.newrelic-external.com/) to find the ARN for your region. Look for either NewRelicLambdaExtension or NewRelicLambdaExtensionARM64 (depending on your function's architecture).
4. Add your `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` as an environment variable.

## Note on performance for ES Module functions

In order to wrap ESM functions without a code change, our wrapper awaits the completion of a dynamic import. If your ESM function depends on a large number of dependency and file imports, you may see long cold start times as a result. As a workaround, we recommend instrumenting manually, following the instructions below.

## Manual instrumentation for ES Modules

First import the New Relic Node agent into your handler file:

```javascript
import newrelic from 'newrelic'
```

Then wrap your handler function using the `.setLambdaHandler` method: 
```javascript
export const handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler(async (event, context) => {
    // TODO implement
    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda!')
    }
})
```
